Hiring Manager\\
Company\\
Toronto, Ontario

\vspace{20pt}
Dear Hiring Manager,\\
\vspace{20pt}

I am writing to express my interest in the [Title] role with [Company]. I am a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto, pursuing minors in Mathematics and Statistics. With a solid foundation in software development and a growing interest in machine learning, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team and gain hands-on experience in an innovation-driven environment.

\vspace{10pt}

I bring experience with Python, TypeScript, and C, as well as frameworks like React, Next.js, and Flask. At the University of Toronto Engineering Career Centre, I built educational tools that boosted engagement by 25\% and automated key workflows. Concurrently, as a Full Stack Developer for UTMIST, I improved site responsiveness for 500+ users and created an observability-focused admin dashboard.


\vspace{10pt}

Beyond internships, I have built and deployed several full-stack applications. One recent project, Toronto Explorer, is a geolocation game using Google Street View and Firebase, which supports over 2,000 randomized playable locations across the city. I also created a Resume Management Web App using Supabase’s row-level security and signed URL system to support secure document handling for over 350 users. These projects helped me strengthen my ability to design scalable and secure systems.

\vspace{10pt}

As VP of External Relations for the Computer Science Student Union, I’ve also developed strong communication and leadership skills by organizing events and securing \$9,000 in sponsorships. I’m confident these combined technical and interpersonal strengths will allow me to contribute meaningfully at [Company].

\vspace{10pt}

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to your team.
